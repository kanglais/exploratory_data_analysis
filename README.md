# Exploratory Data Analysis
This repository contains the first two projects of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree online course. 

The course specifications can be found [here](https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002). The course focuses on preparing students for careers in data analytics. Skills learned are Python, R, SQL, and Tableau. Emphasis is also placed on performing statistical tests, and making reports and decisions based on this data. 

## Project 1 

Project 1 is a statistical analysis of a dataset that tests the Stroop Effect, or the effect that occurs when you try to say the color of a text, rather than the word, while the word is a different color (eg. the word 'red' written in blue). This dataset contained tests completed by a group of 24 people.  

For this project, I used Python. The project reviews certain statistical tests using Pandas, and visualizes these using Numpy and MatPlotLib.  

## Project 2

Project 2 is an exploratory data analysis using R.
